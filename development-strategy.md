2. generated as [this starter template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/w3-validation-template).  
3. Give a title to your README  
4. Clone the repository

8. turn on GitHub Pages

## 1._User Story_: Using header and nav tags

__**As coaches, we want to see header and navbar used in semantic way**__

### Repo

This user story was developed on a branch called `head-nav`

### HTML

- I used `<header> and <nav>` which describe its meaning to both the browser and the developer
- `div` is non-semantic block tag  which will help me with css to manipulating its content
- I gave `id` in div tag which is unique later on I will just change on this part with css or js

- I gave `class` in div tag for css later on which will changes all `class="container" ` align center and gives margin.

- `ul and li` block tags make unorder list  

- `a`inline tag for links the other pages such as `service.html` 

### CSS

After plain HTML, I will change css

## 2. _User Story_: Usig sections element

__**As coaches, we want to see section used in semantic way**__

### Repo

This user story was developed on a branch called `showcase-news`

### HTML

- I used `<section>` which describe its meaning to both the browser and the developer
- `form` block element which user can pass info on it
- `input` inline block element which shows area to user full info 
- `button` inline block element which submit user info to send server

### CSS

After plain HTML, I will change css
